 * We can get compiled in two different modes - 32-bit inode#'s and
 * and 64-bit inode#'s.  On the sun test box, Apache-2 uses 64-bit, perl
 * uses 32-bit which leads to mis-communication and a corrupt temp file.
 * Best solution seems to be to just store them as 64-bit.
 *
 * If your compiler doesn't support "long long", change these to "dev_t"
 * and "ino_t" which should work if you don't have the above problem.
